      "<p>We are managing around 100 servers (Ubuntu 16.XX - 20.XX) and each server has many processes running on them. These processes are very network heavy and open a lot of external connections through the internet as well as connections between each other. And Linux assigns a file descriptor to each of these connections. And each of these connections spawn a thread too, which as I understand also allocates a file descriptor for the thread. We often sit with around 3000 connections per server, and each one has a thread. So we idle at around 6,000 open file descriptors, which is way above the default 1024 limit of Linux.</p>\n",
      "<p>We have tried to raise this limit in multiple ways but nothing really sticks. It's very unpredictable and will often just change back to 1024 for no reason. We have added entries into the /etc/security/limits.conf file, and we have even written code that runs a shell command inside these processes that sets the limits every 5 minutes using the ulimit command. But it still defaults back to 1024 every now and then. We have lost clients as a result of this and the financial impact is becoming quite severe!</p>\n",

A formal specification for such a feature would be a complexity nightmare.\\nOf course, in your particular case, if you are sure that your string always consists of \"currency symbol + sequence of digits without comma or period\", you could develop a string-based solution optimized for your use case (for example, a fancy regular expression). However, I think that your current solution is both readable and maintainable and you would do your future self a favor by keeping it that way. If you need it multiple times, extract it into a method.'}\n",

countryCodes object to associate ISO codes to country names and vice versa, then i build a function that fetches the json and supposedly injects the right formatting into the \\'values\\' property in the svgMap JSON. but i\\'m having trouble getting the fairelaliste() function to work.\\nthe right formatting for the \\'values\\' property for svgMap should be:\\nvalues{\\n    US:{\\n        nbfilms: 1005\\n    },\\n    FR:{\\n        nbfilms: 278\\n    }\\n//etc\\n}\\n\\nso my function supposedly gets the iso code from the country name (codepays variable), then the number of films (filmspays variable), and injects both of those into a new array, then for every element in that array i use the ISO code to select the JSON parameter corresponding to the desired country, then i inject the nbfilms number where it should be... but i\\'m not sure i\\'m allowed to do that, lmao? the map becomes black so something\\'s happening but the console tells me there\\'s errors when reading the ISO code variable?\\nex:\\n\\nUncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading \\'US\\')\\nat l.getTooltipContent (svgMap.min.js:2:12743)\\nat l. (svgMap.min.js:2:10746)\\nthe same error repeats for every country when i hover over them on the map.\\n\\nThanks for helping :(\\nEDIT: i edited the fairelaliste function because i realized i posted the wrong version, sorry!', 'ideal': 'All countries need to be added directly to you values object.\\nYour values var is actually an array of objects. You should rather add all country items like this.\\nvar codepays = \"\";\\nvar filmspays = 0;\\nvar donneespays= {};\\ncodepays = inverseCountryCodes[row.Pays];\\nfilmspays = row.Nb_films;\\nif(codepays){\\n  listedespays[codepays]={nbfilms: filmspays};\\n}\\n\\nBesides, you are initializing the new map instantly while the listedespays data isn\\'t yet retrieved (via fetch() request).\\nJust include your map initialisation new svgMap({...}) in your fairelaliste() call.\\nWorking example\\n\\n\\nvar countryCodes = {\\n  AF: \\'Afghanistan\\',\\n  AX: \\'Îles

We can start with how to unhide that button. When I inspect the hidden button it has class \"shinyjs-hide\", which has the following css rules:\\n.shinyjs-hide {\\n    display: none !important;\\n}\\n\\nSo simply removing the class when the second li is active will show the button, then adding it back when the second li is not active will hide it again. Doing this is fairly straight forward. We can create a function that checks if the li tag that has a data-slide-to attribute equal to 1 has class active. If it\\'s active, change the class of the hidden button to \"shinyjs-show\", which unhides the button. If it\\'s not then change the class to \"shinyjs-hide\", which will hide the button.\\nfunction checkStatus(){\\n\\nsetTimeout(function(){\\n\\nif($( `li[data-slide-to=\\'1\\']` ).attr(\\'class\\')==\\'active\\'){\\n    \\n    $(\\'.shinyjs-hide\\').removeClass().addClass(\\'shinyjs-show\\');\\n\\n} else {\\n\\n    $(\\'.shinyjs-show\\').removeClass().addClass(\\'shinyjs-hide\\');    \\n\\n}\\n\\n}, 60);\\n\\n\\n\\n}\\n\\nNow this function needs to be checked each time either of the left or right arrows are clicked. These have class \"carousel-control\". We can use jQuery to add the onclick attribute, which will be set to \"checkStatus();\" i.e. run the checkStatus() function each time the buttons are clicked.\\n$(\\'.carousel-control\\').attr(\\'onclick\\', \\'checkStatus();\\');\\n\\nThis needs to be run after the page loads, which can be done using shinyjs::runjs() inside the server like this:\\n  session$onFlushed(function() {\\n    shinyjs::runjs(\"$(\\'.carousel-control\\').attr(\\'onclick\\', \\'checkStatus();\\');\\n\")\\n  }, once=TRUE)\\n\\nThe checkStatus() function has a setTimeout() to make the function wait 60ms before running the check, that\\'s because the check needs to be on the slide that has been switched to.\\nPutting it all together in a shiny app like this:\\n\\nlibrary(shiny)\\nlibrary(shinyjs)\\nlibrary(bsplus)\\n\\njs <- HTML(\"\\n\\nfunction checkStatus(){\\n\\nsetTimeout(function(){\\n\\nif($( `li[data-slide-to=\\'1\\']` ).attr(\\'class\\')==\\'active\\'){\\n    \\n    $(\\'.shinyjs-hide\\').removeClass().addClass(\\'shinyjs-show\\');\\n\\n} else {\\n\\n    $(\\'.shinyjs-show\\').removeClass().addClass(\\'shinyjs-hide\\');    \\n\\n}\\n\\n}, 60);\\n\\n}\\n\\n\\n\")\\n\\n\\nui <- fluidPage(\\n  useShinyjs(),\\n  tags$head(tags$script(js)), \\n  hidden(\\n    absolutePanel(\\n      id = \"button1\", top = \"20%\", right = \"20%\", fixed = TRUE, \\n      actionButton(inputId = \"bttn_addmarker\", label = \"button\")\\n    )\\n  )\\n)\\n\\nserver <- function(input, output, session) {\\n  showModal(\\n    modalDialog(\\n      bs_carousel(id = \"examples_carousel\",  use_indicators = TRUE) %>%\\n        bs_set_data(interval = FALSE) %>%\\n        bs_append(\"slide where absolute panel should be hidden\") %>%\\n        bs_append(\"slide where absolute panel should revealed\")\\n    )\\n  )\\n  \\n  session$onFlushed(function() {\\n    shinyjs::runjs(\"$(\\'.carousel-control\\').attr(\\'onclick\\', \\'checkStatus();\\');\\n\")\\n  }, once=TRUE)\\n  \\n  \\n}\\n\\n\\nshinyApp(ui, server)\\n\\n\\ngives:\\n'}\n",

We have added entries into the /etc/security/limits.conf file, and we have even written code that runs a shell command inside these processes that sets the limits every 5 minutes using the ulimit command. But it still defaults back to 1024 every now and then. We have lost clients as a result of this and the financial impact is becoming quite severe!\n",

We often sit with around 3000 connections per server, and each one has a thread. So we idle at around 6,000 open file descriptors, which is way above the default 1024 limit of Linux.\\nWe have tried to raise this limit in multiple ways but nothing really sticks. It's very unpredictable and will often just change back to 1024 for no reason. We have added entries into the /etc/security/limits.conf file, and we have even written code that runs a shell command inside these processes that sets the limits every 5 minutes using the ulimit command. But it still defaults back to 1024 every now and then. We have lost clients as a result of this and the financial impact is becoming quite severe!\\nHere is our /etc/security/limits.conf file\\nroot soft nofile 327680\\nroot hard nofile 655360\\nroot soft nproc 327680\\nroot hard nproc 655360\\nmysql soft nofile 327680\\nmysql hard nofile 655360\\nmysql soft nproc 327680\\nmysql hard nproc 655360\\n\\nAll these processes run as root (I know this is not exactly the safest way, but for now it is what it is for many reasons).\\nOn startup we have added this command in /etc/rc.local/\\nulimit -n 655360\\n\\nAnd then we run the same command from inside the processes on an interval of 5 minutes. But we still sometimes get file limit errors.\\nSo the question is: Is there a way to completely disable the limit mechanism in Linux? Even if we deliberately break it in order to disable it. Can we delete some files so that it breaks / cannot run. Maybe set permissions to certain files to stop it from starting etc etc. We are up for any hardcore hacks to stop and break this thing. It's becomming a massive problem now.\", 'ideal': 'To disable limits (never done before) you can search in PAM modules and comment line:\\nsession  required  pam_limits.so\\n\\nFor set unlimited values you can use command\\nulimit -u unlimited\\n\\nor in /etc/security/limits.conf add lines like:\\nroot soft core unlimited\\nroot hard core unlimited\\nroot soft data unlimited\\nroot hard data unlimited\\nroot soft fsize unlimited\\nroot hard fsize unlimited\\n...\\n'}\n",

So, timestamping is first done over some dummy data to find out the size of the timestamp and this size is included in the calculation of the estimated size of the signature.\\nSince you use the public GemBox.Pdf.Forms.PdfSignature GemBox.Pdf.Forms.PdfSignatureField.Sign(Func<Stream, byte> signer, PdfSignatureFormat signatureFormat, int estimatedSignatureContentsLength)\\nmethod, it means that your TSP provider endpoint already returns a CMS-encoded signature and this CMS-encoded signature must be augmented with a timestamp before being inserted into a signed PDF file. GemBox.Pdf currently doesn\\'t provide this timestamp augmentation, but I am sure this can be easily added if you ask GemBox for this over their official customer support channel.\\nOn the other hand, if your TSP provider also provides an endpoint that returns just the private key signature value, then you can leave the creation of CMS-encoded signature (that includes private key signature value, signer certificate, embedded timestamp, optional validation info (certificate chain, OCSP responses and/or CRLs that make the signature \"LTV enabled\") and all other data required for a valid PAdES signature) to GemBox.Pdf. Combination of examples Digitally sign a PDF file with an external signature (shows how to interoperate between GemBox.Pdf and your TSP provider endpoint that returns the private key signature value) and PAdES B-LT level (shows how to make a PAdES signature that has an embedded timestamp and is \"LTV enabled\") show how this can be done.'}\n",
